### About
CTF Suite is a collection of tools you can use during [Capture The Flag competitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag?scrlybrkr=2f93319c#Computer_security). These tools are aimed at specific categories of problems and are specific to Jeopardy-style CTFs.

The following categories of problems are supported by CTF Suite:
- [Cryptography ("crypto")](#crypto)
- [Forensics ("foren")](#foren)

#### Crypto
Cryptography is the branch of cybersecurity that deals with codes, encryption, etc. One common method of encryption is RSA encryption which you can read more about [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)). To learn more about cryptography, click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography?scrlybrkr=7beeeac3).

#### Foren
Computer forensics involves recovering evidence or data in computers or other forms of digital media. A common example of this is image steganography where you hide data in an image and can recover it using computer forensics skills. Read more about image steganography [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography). To read more about computer forensics, click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_forensics).
